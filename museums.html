                    Museum
                    in Stockholm! Our museum is home to the
                    only preserved 17th-century ship in the world, the Vasa, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1628 and
                    was
                    salvaged in 1961. The ship is an impressive sight to behold, with its ornate carvings and towering
                    masts.

                    its ill-fated voyage, and its eventual recovery. You'll also learn about life in 17th-century Sweden
                    and
                    the fascinating engineering behind the Vasa's design.

                    We offer guided tours and audio guides in several languages, making the Vasa Museum accessible to
