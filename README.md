# Historical Stockholm. Portfolio Project 1 by Patric Svedberg

### This project is my first portfolio piece. The goal was to create a webpage that aids in exploring Stockholm's history, catering to both residents and visitors. Google Maps were utilized to mark noteworthy locations and museums for visitors to explore. Additionally, a dedicated page was included for relevant museums with detailed information.

    # Design

    ## Color:
    I opted for a yellowish hue in the design, inspired by the architecture of Stockholm, particularly the old town, which prominently features yellow tones. Additionally, yellow is often associated with a cheerful and upbeat mood.

    I only used two colors while coding. But I use the colors of the images give it more colors.
    Color code:

    ## Typography:
    This site uses the fonts: <br /> 
    **[Pragati Narrow - Bold 700](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pragati+Narrow?query=praga) <br />**
    **[Martel Light 300](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martel?query=martel) <br />**
    **[Average Sans Regular 400](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Average+Sans?query=Average+Sans) <br />**

    ## Imagery:
    I use images of Stockholm's old town and images from the museums.

    # Technologies Used:

    ## Software Used
    * Gitpod
    * Github
    * Google Chrome Dev Tool

    ## Languages Used:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    <br />
    <br />

    # Testing:

    ## Notes:

    * I've noticed that the round maps are not optimal for mobile use. So they will most likely be a regular square shape for smaller screen sizes. Will investigate the smallest optimal size for round shapes.

    * Managed to make the circle images and maps fit even with smaller sized screens.

    ## Validators:

    * The HTML validator did not like that I did't have a H2-H6 in the "< section >". So I changed to a "< div >" to make the validator warning go away.
