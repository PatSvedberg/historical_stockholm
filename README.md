# Historical Stockholm. Portfolio Project 1 by Patric Svedberg

### This project is my first portfolio piece. The goal was to create a webpage that aids in exploring Stockholm's history, catering to both residents and visitors. Google Maps were utilized to mark noteworthy locations and museums for visitors to explore. Additionally, a dedicated page was included for relevant museums with detailed information.

    # Pages:
    ## About:
    The purpose of this page is to greet visitors and clarify the content of the site.

    ## Maps:
    Embedded in this page is a Google map with personalized markers denoting sites of potential interest for visitors to explore. Additionally, a suggestion box is available for visitors to provide feedback about any missing locations.

    ## Museums:
    This page has a great collection of relevant museums, complete with informative details about each one.

    # User Experience

    # Design

    ## Color Scheme:
    I opted for a yellowish hue in the design, inspired by the architecture of Stockholm, particularly the old town, which prominently features yellow tones. Additionally, yellow is often associated with a cheerful and upbeat mood.

    Yellow color: #b8973d

    ## Typography:
    This site uses the font **Pragati Narrow - Bold 700**, **Martel - Light 300** and **Average Sans - Regular 400**

    ## Imagery:
    I use images of Stockholm's old town and images from the museums.

    # Technologies Used:

    ## Languages Used:
    HTML and CSS

    # Testing:

    ## Mobile use:    
    I've noticed that the round maps are not optimal for mobile use. So they will most likely be a regular square shape for smaller screen sizes. Will investigate the smallest optimal size for round shapes.
