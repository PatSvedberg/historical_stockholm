# Historical Stockholm. Portfolio Project 1 by Patric Svedberg

### This project is my first portfolio piece. The goal was to create a webpage that aids in exploring Stockholm's history, catering to both residents and visitors. Google Maps were utilized to mark noteworthy locations and museums for visitors to explore. Additionally, a dedicated page was included for relevant museums with detailed information.

    # User Experience

    # Design

    ## Color Scheme:
    I opted for a yellowish hue in the design, inspired by the architecture of Stockholm, particularly the old town, which prominently features yellow tones. Additionally, yellow is often associated with a cheerful and upbeat mood.

    ## Typography:
    This site uses the font **Pragati Narrow - Bold 700**, **Martel - Light 300** and **Average Sans - Regular 400**

    ## Imagery:
    I use images of Stockholm's old town and images from the museums.
